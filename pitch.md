## The Pitch for Decentralized Digital Hard Money and Why Coined Watts Lab

_In dialoge form, a pitch for regular people and small business on why they should adopt digital hard money, e.g. bitcoin, cardano, ergo_

(Coined Watts, what the hell kind of name is that?)

Your money is losing energy. 

(What??) 

That’s right. It doesn’t hold value. It’s literally leaking energy. 

At the current rate of inflation 8.5% year-over-year, in 8 years your cash savings will be cut in half in “value”.

(How?) 

Because the government keeps printing money, or “fiat” paper.  It used to be backed by gold, but since 1971 it is now backed by nothing but thin air and a promise, diluting your purchasing power. 

(Isn’t more money good?)

Not when there’s more money for the same amount of goods and services, your money gets diluted. Like more water in your mixed drink, same amount of alcohol.  It’s just more money to throw at the same stuff.

(So how does money hold energy?)

Well, when you work you are exerting energy over time.  Thinking, walking, lifting, and creating things. Your reward in exchange for work is money. 

If you capture your hard work in money, you are capturing time and energy too. Money, or captured energy, to be saved and spent in the future.

(Weird, but okay … So what should I do?)

Save in decentralized, digital hard money, or the following cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ada, and erg.  They have a fixed supply (scarce) and the money policy is governed by code, not people.  It is digital money that is the separation of Money and the State.

(How do I get started?)

At Coined Watts, it is our moral obligation to help common folks, families, businesses, and local communities.  

So we can have a follow up discussion on more education and next steps.  Read our whitepaper and keep going down the rabbit hole my friend.
